Trainer Academy — a small web app that analyzes Pokémon Showdown / Smogon data to surface move usage, win rates, and common teammate combos. Still early and under active development.

This started as my final‑year university project, but ready for the community to try — I’ll keep developing it as long as users find it useful!

What it does
- Shows move & combo win rates, common teammates, and basic team insights.
- Parses public replays to highlight trends.

A few notes
- Some sections (for example the forum) are intentionally basic for now and are pending improvements.
- It’s normal to find bugs or rough edges — please report them so I can fix and improve things. The project stays in development while it’s useful to the community.

For any questions, suggestions, or feedback, email support@traineracademy.xyz.

Thanks for checking it out — I’m excited to hear what you think!

This is a fan project — not affiliated with Nintendo/Game Freak/The Pokémon Company.
